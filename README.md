# Assembly subroutines for the z80

This is a collection of z80 assembly subroutines, mainly for use in assembly programming on
the TI-83/84+ graphing calculators.

Theses subroutines are divided into two major groups: those that depend on TI-OS
(these might use `bcalls` or need labels defined by `ti83plus.in`) and general 
routines that do not depend on any specific OS.
